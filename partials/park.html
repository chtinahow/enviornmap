    <h2>General Info</h2>
    <p>
      Yellowstone National Park is a nearly 3,500-sq.-mile wilderness recreation area atop a volcanic hot spot.
      Mostly in Wyoming, the park spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho too. Yellowstone features dramatic canyons,
      alpine rivers, lush forests, hot springs and gushing geysers, including its most famous, Old Faithful.
      It's also home to hundreds of animal species, including bears, wolves, bison, elk and antelope.

        During the late spring, summer, and fall (year-round for the North-Northeast entrances)
        park entrances and roads are open 24 hours for entry, exit, and travel. Please remember
        to travel at or below the posted speed limit of 45 mph (or lower where posted) when driving
        Yellowstone roads from dusk until early morning due to the possibility of encountering wildlife along park roadways.
